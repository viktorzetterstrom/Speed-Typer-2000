# Speed-Typer-2000

## About this project

This project was created as part of the course DT146G - Web Programming with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (7.5 Credits) at the Mid Sweden University. The app lets the user type in one of eight predefined texts with the goal of doing it as fast as they can.

## Running

The app is started by either pressing the enter key or by pressing the start button right below the typing area. Focus is automatically put into the textbox for typing when the game is started.

## Settings

The user can change the language of the texts by pressing one of the two radio buttons. There is also an ignore casing option.
